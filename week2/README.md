# Week 2

Dir contains things of  Week 2 CMEECourseWork.(python week)

## Structure

- **code:** All scripts will be at here

- **data:** All data files

- **result:** Place for keeping results of scripts,but only gitkeep will be tracked.


## Scripts in week2

##### Basic Python Scripts
* `boilerplate.py`: 
  - Basic template for Python scripts with standardized structure. Demonstrates proper script organization with main function and command line arguments

* `using_name.py`:
  - Shows how Python's `__name__` variable works. Explains the difference between running a script directly vs importing it

* `MyExampleScript.py`:
  - Introductory script showing basic Python syntax. Contains examples of variable declarations and simple functions

##### Control Flow Scripts
* `control_flow.py`:
  - Comprehensive examples of Python control structures. Includes if-else statements, for loops, and while loops with practical examples

* `cfexercises1.py`:
  - Mathematical operations using control flow. Demonstrates condition handling and loop implementations

* `cfexercises2.py`:
  - Advanced control flow practice with functions. Shows nested loops and complex conditional logic

* `test_control_flow.py`:
  - Unit tests for control flow functions. Examples of test case design and assertion usage

* `loops.py`:
  - Different types of loop implementations. Shows while, for, and nested loop examples

##### Data Structure Scripts
* `dictionary.py`:
  - Complete guide to Python dictionary operations. Includes creation, modification, deletion, and iteration examples

* `tuple.py`:
  - Demonstrates tuple properties and operations. Shows immutability and tuple unpacking features

* `lc1.py`:
  - Basic list comprehension exercises. Shows how to replace loops with list comprehensions

* `lc2.py`:
  - Advanced list comprehension examples. Includes nested comprehensions and conditional filtering

##### File Operations
* `basic_io1.py`:
  - Basic file reading operations. Shows different methods to read text files.

* `basic_io2.py`:
  - File writing operations demonstration. Includes text and formatted output examples.

* `basic_io3.py`:
  - Advanced file handling techniques. Demonstrates binary file operations.

* `basic_csv.py`:
  - CSV file manipulation examples. Shows reading, writing, and processing CSV data.

## Practical
* `align_seqs.py`:
  - DNA sequence alignment algorithm implementation. Finds best alignment between two DNA sequences.

* `align_seqs_fasta.py`:
  - Enhanced DNA sequence alignment for FASTA files. Includes FASTA format parsing and handling.

* `oaks.py`:
  - Script for analyzing oak species data. Demonstrates data filtering and processing.

* `oaks_debugme.py`:
  - Debugging version of oak species analysis. Shows common debugging techniques and error handling.

* `debugme.py`:
  - Examples of debugging methods. Includes various debugging scenarios and solutions.

## Data Files
* `DNA1.txt`, `DNA2.txt`:
  - Sample DNA sequence files. Used by alignment scripts for testing.

* `TestOaksData.csv`:
  - Dataset containing tree species information. Used for oak species analysis.

* `testcsv.csv`:
  - Sample CSV file for testing. Used in basic CSV operations examples.
