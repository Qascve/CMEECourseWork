# Desc: bash command challenge

# Task 1:
# Modify the command so that it prints file sizes in human-readable format (kb, mb, etc.)
echo "\n Task 1: \n"
find . -type f -exec ls -sh {} \; | sort -n | head -10
# ls-s shows file size in blocks, -h makes it human-readable
# sort -n show first column by default ,which is the file size

# Task 2:
# imporeve the preformance of the command by using a different approach
echo "\n Task 2: \n"
find . -type f -exec ls -sh {} +; | sort -h | head -10
# Using {} + instead of {} \; makes find pass multiple files at once to ls, 
#    reducing the number of times ls is called and improving performance.

# Task 3:
# Avoid too many calls of ls by using xargs
echo "\n Task 3: \n"
find . -type f | xargs ls -sh | sort -h | head -10
# xargs collects the output of find and passes it to ls in larger batches,
#    further reducing the number of ls calls and improving efficiency.
